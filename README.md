# Bookings_analysis

This project is a final work for a Master's Degree. I'm working to adapt the notebook file to GitHub people in order to use easily. With my colleages of Master's Degree, we tried to test some predictive models based on decision trees and also using some advanced technic based on machine learning.

The .csv file is in drive, because is too large to keep in GitHub.
